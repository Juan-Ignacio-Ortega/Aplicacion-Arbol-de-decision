## 2 - Introduction
Mycotoxins are ubiquitous compounds that differ greatly in their chemical, biological, and toxicological properties. A primary mycotoxicosis is produced by consuming contaminated vegetables, and secondary by ingesting meat or milk from animals that ate forage with mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are ingested with directly or indirectly contaminated food or feed.

The presence of a mycotoxin, and the associated hazard, can only be determined after extraction and identification because: - the presence of the fungus does not ensure that a mycotoxin exists, - the mycotoxin remains in the feed even though the mold has disappeared , - a given fungus can produce more than one mycotoxin, - a given toxin can be formed by more than one species of molds [3].

For this reason, it is intended to generate an algorithm capable of classifying whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible according to certain characteristics, for this, an algorithm based on ID3 is proposed to generate a decision tree.

Inductive inference is the process of going from concrete examples to general models. In one form, the goal is to learn to classify objects or situations by analyzing a set of instances whose classes are known [5].

A decision tree is a formalism for expressing mappings. A tree is a leaf node labeled with a class or a structure consisting of a test node linked to two or more subtrees. A test node computes some result based on the attribute values ​​of an instance, where each possible result is associated with one of the subtrees[5].

The data mining techniques basically use the ID3 algorithm since it is the basic classification algorithm, they propose a generic decision tree framework that supports the design of reusable components. [2].
